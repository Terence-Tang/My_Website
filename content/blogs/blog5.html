<h1>Introduction</h1>
<div id="what-is-global-warming" class="section level2">
<h2>What is Global Warming?</h2>
<p>Global warming is the slow increase in the average temperature of the earth’s atmosphere because an increased amount of the energy (heat) striking the earth from the sun is being trapped in the atmosphere and not radiated out into space.</p>
<p>The earth’s atmosphere has always acted like a greenhouse to capture the sun’s heat, ensuring that the earth has enjoyed temperatures that permitted the emergence of life forms as we know them, including humans.</p>
<p>Without our atmospheric greenhouse the earth would be very cold. Global warming, however, is the equivalent of a greenhouse with high efficiency reflective glass installed the wrong way around.</p>
<p>The best evidence of this may come from a terrible cooling event that took place some 1,500 years ago. Two massive volcanic eruptions, one year after another placed so much black dust into the upper atmosphere that little sunlight could penetrate. Temperatures plummeted. Crops failed. People died of starvation and the Black Death started its march. As the dust slowly fell to earth, the sun was again able to warn the world and life returned to normal.
Today, we have the opposite problem. Today, the problem is not that too little sun warmth is reaching the earth, but that too much is being trapped in our atmosphere. So much heat is being kept inside greenhouse earth that the temperature of the earth is going up faster than at any previous time in history.</p>

<div id="how-does-global-warming-drive-climate-change" class="section level2">
<h2>How does Global Warming drive Climate Change?</h2>
<p>Heat is energy and when you add energy to any system changes occur. Because all systems in the global climate system are connected, adding heat energy causes the global climate as a whole to change.</p>
<p>Much of the world is covered with ocean which heats up. When the ocean heats up, more water evaporates into clouds.</p>
<p>Where storms like hurricanes and typhoons are forming, the result is more energy-intensive storms. A warmer atmosphere makes glaciers and mountain snow packs, the Polar ice cap, and the great ice shield jutting off of Antarctica melt raising sea levels.</p>

<div id="how-can-we-study-climate-change" class="section level2">
<h2>How can we study climate change?</h2>
<p>If we wanted to study climate change, we can find data on the <em>Combined Land-Surface Air and Sea-Surface Water Temperature Anomalies</em> in the Northern Hemisphere at <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp">NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies</a>. The <a href="https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.txt">tabular data of temperature anomalies can be found here</a></p>
<p>To define temperature anomalies, we need to have a reference, or base, period which NASA clearly states that it is the period between 1951-1980.</p>
<p>Run the code below to load the file:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>weather &lt;- 
  read_csv(&quot;https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/NH.Ts+dSST.csv&quot;, 
           skip = 1, 
           na = &quot;***&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>We can clean the data using following code, to get the tidy dataframe.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidyweather &lt;- weather %&gt;% 
  select(-c(14,15,16,17,18,19)) %&gt;% #delete colomns we don&#39;t need 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:13, #columns 2 to 13
               names_to = &quot;month&quot;,
               values_to = &quot;delta&quot;)</code></pre>
</div>
<div id="plotting-information" class="section level2">
<h2>Plotting Information</h2>
<p>We can plot the data using a time-series scatter plot, and add a trendline.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>tidyweather &lt;- tidyweather %&gt;%
  
  # clean date
  mutate(date = ymd(paste(as.character(Year), month, &quot;1&quot;)),
         month = month(date, label=TRUE),
         year = year(date))
  
  # create plot
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=Year, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color=&quot;red&quot;) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = &quot;Weather Anomalies&quot;,
    y = &quot;Temperature deviation&quot;,
    subtitle = &quot;Global warming has been taking place over the past 50 years&quot;
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/blog5_files/figure-html/scatter_plot-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>Is the effect of increasing temperature more pronounced in some months? We can see from the plot below:</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Use `facet_wrap()` to produce a seperate scatter plot for each month, again with a smoothing line
ggplot(tidyweather, aes(x=Year, y = delta))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(color=&quot;red&quot;) +
  theme_bw() +
  facet_wrap(~month)+
  labs (
    title = &quot;Weather Anomalies&quot;,
    y = &quot;Temperature deviation&quot;,
    subtitle = &quot;The global warming effect is pronounced even across every month&quot;
    )</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/blog5_files/figure-html/facet_wrap-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>It is sometimes useful to group data into different time periods to study historical data. For example, we often refer to decades such as 1970s, 1980s, 1990s etc. to refer to a period of time. NASA calculates a temperature anomaly, as difference form the base period of of 1951-1980. The code below creates a new data frame called <code>comparison</code> that groups data in five time periods: 1881-1920, 1921-1950, 1951-1980, 1981-2010 and 2011-present.</p>
<p>We remove data before 1800 and before using <code>filter</code>. Then, we use the <code>mutate</code> function to create a new variable <code>interval</code> which contains information on which period each observation belongs to. We can assign the different periods using <code>case_when()</code>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>comparison &lt;- tidyweather %&gt;% 
  filter(Year&gt;= 1881) %&gt;%     #remove years prior to 1881
  #create new variable &#39;interval&#39;, and assign values based on criteria below:
  mutate(interval = case_when(
    Year %in% c(1881:1920) ~ &quot;1881-1920&quot;,
    Year %in% c(1921:1950) ~ &quot;1921-1950&quot;,
    Year %in% c(1951:1980) ~ &quot;1951-1980&quot;,
    Year %in% c(1981:2010) ~ &quot;1981-2010&quot;,
    TRUE ~ &quot;2011-present&quot;
  ))</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have the <code>interval</code> variable, we can create a density plot to study the distribution of monthly deviations (<code>delta</code>), grouped by the different time periods we are interested in. Set <code>fill</code> to <code>interval</code> to group and colour the data by different time periods.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(comparison, aes(x=delta, fill=interval))+
  geom_density(alpha=0.2) +   #density plot with tranparency set to 20%
  theme_bw() +                #theme
  labs (
    title = &quot;Density Plot for Monthly Temperature Anomalies&quot;,
    y     = &quot;Density&quot;         #changing y-axis label to sentence case
  )</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/blog5_files/figure-html/density_plot-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>
<p>So far, we have been working with monthly anomalies. However, we might be interested in average annual anomalies. We can do this by using <code>group_by()</code> and <code>summarise()</code>, followed by a scatter plot to display the result.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#creating yearly averages
average_annual_anomaly &lt;- tidyweather %&gt;% 
  group_by(Year) %&gt;%   #grouping data by Year
  
  # creating summaries for mean delta 
  # use `na.rm=TRUE` to eliminate NA (not available) values 
  summarise(annual_average_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE)) 

#plotting the data:
ggplot(average_annual_anomaly, aes(x=Year, y= annual_average_delta))+
  geom_point()+
  
  #Fit the best fit line, using LOESS method
  geom_smooth() +
  
  #change to theme_bw() to have white background + black frame around plot
  theme_bw() +
  labs (
    title = &quot;Average Yearly Anomaly&quot;,
    y     = &quot;Average Annual Delta&quot;
  )                         </code></pre>
<p><img src="/blogs/blog5_files/figure-html/averaging-1.png" width="648" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /></p>

<div id="confidence-interval-for-delta" class="section level2">
<h2>Confidence Interval for delta</h2>
<p><a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/world-of-change/decadaltemp.php">NASA points out on their website</a> that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A one-degree global change is significant because it takes a vast amount of heat to warm all the oceans, atmosphere, and land by that much. In the past, a one- to two-degree drop was all it took to plunge the Earth into the Little Ice Age.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To construct a confidence interval for the average annual delta since 2011, we could use a formula or use a bootstrap simulation with the <code>infer</code> package.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>formula_ci &lt;- comparison %&gt;% 

  # choose the interval 2011-present
  filter(interval == &quot;2011-present&quot;) %&gt;% 
  summarise(mean_delta = mean(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
  sd_delta = sd(delta, na.rm=TRUE),
  count = n(),
  se_delta = sd_delta/sqrt(count),
  t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
  lower_bound = mean_delta - t_critical * se_delta,
  upper_bound = mean_delta + t_critical * se_delta)
