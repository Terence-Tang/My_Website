# Trump's Approval Margins

To conduct our research, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-approval-ratings)

Let's get the tidy dataframe first.

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Importing approval polls data
approval_polllist <- read_csv(here::here("data", "trump.csv")) 

glimpse(approval_polllist)

approval_polllist_tidy <- approval_polllist %>%
   mutate(enddate_date = mdy(enddate),
          enddate_month = month(enddate_date, label=TRUE),
          enddate_year = year(enddate_date))
```

## Create a plot

We would like to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. We plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval.

```{r trump_margins, warning=FALSE, out.width="100%"}

#clean data
approvalrate <- approval_polllist %>%
  mutate(net_approval = approve - disapprove,

#arrange date 
         enddate = mdy(enddate),
         week = week(enddate),
         year = year(enddate),
         year_cha = paste(as.character(year))) %>%
  
#calculate SD and CI
  group_by(year, week) %>%
  mutate(average_net_approval_week = mean(net_approval)) %>%
  mutate(sd_approval = sd(net_approval) / sqrt(count(week)-1),
         upper = average_net_approval_week + 1.96 * sd_approval,
         lower = average_net_approval_week - 1.96 * sd_approval)

#create plot
ggplot(approvalrate, aes(x = week, y = average_net_approval_week)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour = year_cha)) +
  
#upper and lower line
  geom_line(aes(y = upper, colour = year_cha)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = lower, colour = year_cha)) +
  
#y=0 line
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, colour = "orange") +
  geom_point(size = 1, aes(colour = year_cha)) +
  geom_ribbon(alpha = 0.2,
              aes(ymin = lower, ymax = upper, fill = year_cha)) +
  
#facet by year
  facet_wrap(~year,
             scales = "fixed",
             ncol = 2) +
  
#We can fill it with color: scale_fill_manual(values=c("red", "green", "blue", "purple")) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0,52,13)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(-20,7.5,2.5)) +

#theme of the plot
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +

#title and labels  
    labs (
    title = "Estimating Net Approval (approve-disapprove) for Donald Trump",
    x     = "Week of the year",
    y     = "Average Net Approval (%)",
    subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls"
  )
```

## Compare Confidence Intervals

Compare the confidence intervals for `week 15` (6-12 April 2020) and `week 34` (17-23 August 2020). What happened?

```{r trump_margins_CI, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
approvalrate %>%
  filter(year == 2020, week == 15 | week == 34) %>% 
  summarise(mean(upper), mean(lower))
```
>In early-mid April (week 15), unlike its European counterparts, the US was only at the beginning of the growing wave of covid-19 cases clustered priomarily in NYC. However, by the end of August (week 34) there were far more cases and deaths recorded across the country together with the job losses. Moreover, the summer highlighted the persistent social issue of the America with the Black Lives Matter protests that Trump neglected. These reasons may explain a mucher greater discrepancy in the opinions of the respondents that in turn led to a larger standard error in net approvals and therefore CI expanding from ca. 1.33% to 3.08%.
